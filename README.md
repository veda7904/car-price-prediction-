Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
Purpose :
This project aims to predict the price of a car based on various features using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and deployment-ready structure for real-world use cases.

 Components :
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation, feature importance, and visualizations.
Model Training: Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
Evaluation: R² score, RMSE, MAE.
Deployment Ready: Model serialization using joblib.

Technologies Used :
Python
Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Joblib
